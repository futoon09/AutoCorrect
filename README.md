# AutoCorrect

A word correction program similar to those found in cell phone or email
clients. User may enter a word, press ENTER, and if the word is spelled
correctly, the program prints "Correct." If not, and the word is merely
mispelled, the program suggests words that the user might have intended.
Lastly, if the word does not resemble any dictionary words, the program
prints "No suggestions." Dictionary words are loaded from words.txt.
